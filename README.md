> Unfortunately, your app does not meet our standards in terms of speed. The Y axis produces a lag when scrolling graphs.  
The app also doesn't fully comply with the design guidelines provided for the contest (fonts, relative scale and positioning of elements, peaks on graphs are not smooth). Please note that the task was to display the charts on one screen.
